This project is a event management android application written in Kotlin to organise events in our college. The idea was to replace the traditional way of circulating google forms for registration with an application that can be logged into using college email addresses. The faculty can create events that can be registered to by the students and faculty. 

We used Kotlin, Java and XML for coding.
We also use Firebase NoSQL database to store the event, student and faculty data.
